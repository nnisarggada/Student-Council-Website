        <h1> The Tech Festival </h1>
        <p> Taqneeq is the annual science and technology festival of MPSTME. Taqneeq originated to provide a platform for the Indian
        student community to develop and showcase their technical prowess. It has been attracting people from all walks of life,
        including students, academia, and professionals. It has grown so much that last year it saw participation from all over
        the world! We are a student body which aims to host other students from all facets of engineering. We organize
        hackathons, the internship fair, coding contests, Talk shows and thrilling yet fun events which you would not find
        anywhere else. A platform where we work towards excellence, keeping in mind that success is not final, failure is not
        fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. Taqneeq continues to keep the ‘T’ in MPSTME bold and shining.
    
            <br>
            <br>
    
            Cyber Cypher was the pre-event of the Annual technical fest - Taqneeq 14.0. It was a 24- hour Hackathon organized online
            on a discord channel curated exclusively for this hackathon. The event was graced by the chief guest - Vivek Gupta, EVP
            and Head, Technology at CoinDCX and an iconic guest panel as well. There were two domains - *Elementary* : To test the
            fundamentals of the participants. *Advanced* : To develop AI based solutions using software.

            <br>
            <br>

            Taqneeq Day 1: Taqneeq officially took off on 21st March with Viraj Ghelani starting off with a power-packed fiesta to
            kickstart the inauguration. Followed by a Game development workshop, QR Shooter etc. But the best part was "The Talk".
            Where the one and only Raj Shamani, Arif Amirani, Sanjay Vakharia and Ashok Ramchandran enlightened the hearts of
            passionate individuals who wished to make a difference. With a footfall of close to 1500 people, Taqneeq 22' was a
            massive success.
            <br>
            Taqneeq Day 2: On the 2nd Day of Taqneeq we had the hackathon Dare to Compile with a Cash Prize of
            10,000/- where participants had to solve 3 questions within a time crunch of just two hours. But what's Taqneeq without
            its Fun events and value adding workshops? And hence the team also organized games like Human skate bowl, Catch your
            match, Flick and Dunk and the ever needed Counter Intelligence Workshop plus a stock market workshop. 
            <br>
            Taqneeq Day 3: The
            Internship Fair: Keeping the uproar loud, the final day of Taqneeq 14.0 hosted the highlight of the fiesta "The
            Internship Fair" on the 23rd March 2022. Where companies from acrossl came to give the students a chance to explore and
            actually get hitched with an Internship in companies like Virtual Cyber Labs, Kreative Bricks and so many more. Around
            300 students were found to be applying in the internship fair, making it the perfect platform for Internships at MPSTME
            NMIMS.
