                <h1>The Tech Festival</h1>     
                <p> Taqneeq is the annual science and technology festival of MPSTME. Taqneeq originated to provide a platform for the Indian student community to develop and showcase their technical prowess. It has been attracting people from all walks of life, including students, academia, and professionals. It has grown so much that last year it saw participation from all over the world! We are a student body which aims to host other students from all facets of engineering. We organize hackathons, the internship fair, coding contests, Talk shows and thrilling yet fun events which you would not find anywhere else. A platform where we work towards excellence, keeping in mind that success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. Taqneeq continues to keep the ‘T’ in MPSTME bold and shining.  
                </p>
                <h1>Pre Event</h1>     
                <p><b>Cyber Cypher</b> was the pre-event of the Annual technical fest - Taqneeq 14.0. It was a 24- hour Hackathon organized online on a discord channel curated exclusively for this hackathon.
 
                    The event was graced by the chief guest - Vivek Gupta, EVP and Head, Technology at CoinDCX and an iconic guest panel as well.
                    There were two domains -
                     
                    *Elementary* : To test the fundamentals of the participants.
                    *Advanced* : To develop AI based solutions using software.
                </p>
                <h1>Flagship Events</h1>
                <p>Taqneeq Day 1:
 
                    Taqneeq officially took off on 21st  March with Viraj Ghelani starting off with a power-packed fiesta to kickstart the inauguration.
                    Followed by a Game development workshop, QR Shooter etc. But the best part was "The Talk". Where the one and only Raj Shamani, Arif Amirani, Sanjay Vakharia and Ashok Ramchandran enlightened the hearts of passionate individuals who wished to make a difference.
                    With a footfall of close to 1500 people, Taqneeq 22' was a massive success.
                    
                    Taqneeq Day 2:
                    
                    On the 2nd Day of Taqneeq we had the hackathon Dare to Compile with a Cash Prize of 10,000/- where participants had to solve 3 questions within a time crunch of just two hours. But what's Taqneeq without its Fun events and value adding workshops? And hence the team also organized games like Human skate bowl, Catch your match, Flick and Dunk and the ever needed Counter Intelligence Workshop plus a stock market workshop.
                    
                    Taqneeq Day 3/ The Internship Fair:
                    
                    Keeping the uproar loud, the final day of Taqneeq 14.0 hosted the highlight of the fiesta "The Internship Fair" on the 23rd March 2022.
                     
                    Where companies from acrossl came to give the students a chance to explore and actually get hitched with an Internship in companies like Virtual Cyber Labs, Kreative Bricks and so many more.
                     
                    Around 300 students were found to be applying in the internship fair, making it the perfect platform for Internships at MPSTME NMIMS.
