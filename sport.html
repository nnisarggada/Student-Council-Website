        <h1> Vision </h1>
        <p> A team that works together and makes sure that every event is carried out with great enthusiasm and teamwork
            or as we
            would like to say, a team that gets tanned together, stays together.
            We manage all the various sports teams of our college namely Cricket, Basketball, Table Tennis and Football
            and we make
            sure we organize amazing events for all the exceptionally talented teams. Events such as College Cricket
            League, Neymar
            Jr. Five & College Turf Tournament, Intra College Table Tennis and Carrom Tournament, Gamers Asylum and much
            more.
            Alongside organizing events for the students, we also organize events for the faculty and staff. Our motive
            is to
            further increase female participation in various events.
