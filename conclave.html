        <h1> Global Convention </h1>
        <p> The 3-day conference starts with the opening ceremony at our college, Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management &
        Engineering, NMIMS. The delegates are given delegate kits which includes everything they need during and about the
        conference. We then move to the introduction of the agendas to the delegates and panel of experts and start with our
        keynote speaker for each agenda. After which the panel introduces themselves and give a brief overview of their
        thoughts, ideas, vision, and ideology about the agenda, followed by an hour-long Panel discussion on the proposed
        agenda. This helps the delegates gain much better insights on the agenda through the discussions of the different
        experts in various fields. Over the years we have been joined by various renowned keynote speakers like Ujjwal Nikam,
        Sucheta Dalal, Vivek Oberoi, Pankaja Gopinath Munde, Anupria Goenka, Jamnadas Majethia, Pragya Kapoor, Shri Vishwas
        Nangare Patil, Susi Pudjiastuti, and Dr. Ganesh Nagarajan.
            <br>

            The delegates accompanied by the organising committee members, go for a field visit to an organisation that works
            towards the agenda at hand. This visit is usually to their place of activity to get a better understanding of the
            significance of the agenda by observing the work and real-life cases/activities. Here, the organisation may present
            their work through a presentation/talk/skit OR the delegates take part or observe the activities happening. It showcases
            the gravity of the topic to the delegates and aids them in the next part of the day, that is, the mock panchayat. Social
            Conclave’22 had all successful field visits to Tata Motors, Bharatiya Stree Shakti, Udaan Welfare Foundation and Healing
            Our Planet Earth & Nirmal Plastics. After learning and understanding the agenda throughout the 3 days, the delegates are
            given time to propose solutions to a panel of judges. The delegates start showcasing their presentations to the judges
            and based on how well the delegates have understood the situation and on various factors of the solution, they will be
            assigned points by the judges. According to which the winners will be chosen. Additionally, the conference also
            comprises a recreational night, last year, we welcomed famous singer Neeti Mohan with her single “Naari” a special song
            celebrating and dedicated to womanhood. We were also joined by comedian Sahil Shah for a night of fun and laughter. The
            delegates also enjoyed our well-designed rec room which included activities like Seconds Of Euphoria, Picture Abhi Baaki
            Hai, Cheat Code, Karaoke Room, Kick Off, and Conclave Capture.
