        <h1> Vision </h1>
        <p> MPSTME’s Social Impact is a student council committee which preaches the
            motto ‘’great things are done by a series of small things brought together”. All
            members of this committee work unitedly towards a single goal, which is to
            exhaust the resources at hand to extend help to all who need it. The Social
            Impact, in association with different NGO’s, works tirelessly towards
            eradication of various issues plaguing the society, like Female Health and
            Sanitation and Importance of Mental Health. The aim of the committee is to
            make a significant difference to the lives of people in need by contributing little
            by little to the cause each day.

                <b> Social Conclave </b>
                <br>
                Backed by the United Nations, Social Conclave is a socio-economic
                conference in which significant issues are discussed with the goal of
                bringing about positive changes in various walks of life. Delegates from
                across the country gather together to discuss the worst kind of social issues
                plaguing the society, with the unified aim of finding a sustainable solution,
                which can be implemented on ground level.
                For expert guidance on such critical issues, eminent speakers attend this
                conference, who know more about the ground level situations than we do.
                Social Conclave consists of field visits according to the problem being
                discussed, to get a better idea and improve the corresponding solutions. The
                three-day conference also consists of a social mixer, to make delegates
                interact and feel more comfortable, and a mock panchayat.

                cause gave information, advice, and encouragement to the audience on

                things which can be done to avoid mental health issues, and also how to
