        <h1>The Students’ Council</h1>
        <p>The Students’ Council of NMIMS MPSTME is the foundation that helps students flourish by providing a multitude of  co-curricular, extracurricular, and athletic opportunities. Our vision is to harness the creative potential of students through the Sports, Culture, Social, Literature and Technical forums under its domain. We at the Students’ Council believe in providing students with valuable learning experiences and promote a sense of community.</p>

          <b>Colloquium</b> is a committee pertaining to the business domain that generates ideas and leaders that have the power to transform the world. They bring to us their flagship event of Stockraze and Bizneeti.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Cultural Committee</b> provides a platform to display one’s creativity and showcase their talent. They host the Cultural Night, a night of entertainment for everyone to revel in.  
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Editorial Board</b> brings together the world of art, literature and popular culture. The Editorial Project is one among the many events they produce that truly celebrates fine arts.
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Research Cell</b> guides students to turn ideas into reality. They organise the Mentor-Mentee Program, a great depiction of their belief as a committee. 
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Social Impact</b> strives to bring about changes in society through cultivating the aspect of social responsibilities in future leaders. They established their very own Social Conclave, an event that works closely at finding solutions to social problems. 
          <br>
          <br>


          <b>Sports Committee</b> is a platform for all athletes of the institute. They host Conquest and Conquer, which facilitates highlighting the sports culture among students. 
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Technical Committee</b> believes in imparting knowledge to all by encouraging technological aptitude among students and Taqneeq promotes exactly that. 
          <br>
          <br>

          <b>Voices</b> is an initiative launched by MPSTME’s Lady Representative. It is a women centric cell that helps women grow together and provides a platform for women to voice their beliefs and obstacles alike. They established the event of Breast Cancer Awareness Month at our institute.
          <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>The Students' Council successfully hosted SATTVA 2022, the annual cultural fest of NMIMS MPSTME, held in a hybrid mode, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team accomplished having some big names in the entertainment industry join in for the event. 

        The Students’ Council is not just the backbone for an array of clubs at the institute, but also acts as the bridge between the academic and co-curricular aspect of a student’s education. We not only provide opportunities to help students finess their soft skills but also give them the freedom to have experiences of a lifetime, recollections, they often find themselves going back to. The ties and bonds formed here stay forever, no matter where one goes.</p>
